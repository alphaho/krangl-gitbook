# Time Series

### Basics

Analyzing time series works like a breeze with `krangl`. Conceptually, timeseries are simply tables with a ``java.util.Date``` column.  They can be analyzed by means of grouping and aggregation as any other data frame.

```kotlin
.// load bundled example data
??
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
